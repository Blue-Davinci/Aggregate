Users can effortlessly follow their favorite content, whether it‚Äôs news, blogs, or other updates. The project emphasizes efficiency, security, and a user-friendly experience, making it a valuable tool for staying informed in today‚Äôs fast-paced digital landscape. üöÄüåê

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run or contribute to this project, you'll need to have the following software installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/): The project is written in Go, so you'll need to have Go installed to run or modify the code.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/): The project uses a PostgreSQL database, so you'll need to have PostgreSQL installed and know how to create a database.
- A Go IDE or text editor: While not strictly necessary, a Go IDE or a text editor with Go support can make it easier to work with the code. I use vscode.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): You'll need Git to clone the repo.

<hr />

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository:** Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/blue-davinci/aggregate.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd aggregate
    ```

3. **Install the Go dependencies:** The Go tools will automatically download and install the dependencies listed in the `go.mod` file when you build or run the project. To download the dependencies without building or running the project, you can use the `go mod download` command:

    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```
4. **Set up the database:** The project uses a PostgreSQL database. You'll need to create a new database and update the connection string in your configuration file or environment variables.
We use `GOOSE` for all the data migrations and `SQLC` as the abstraction layer for the DB. To proceed
with the migration, navigate to the `Schema` director:

```bash
cd internal\sql\schema
```
- Then proceed by using the `goose {connection string} up` to execute an <b>Up migration</b> as shown:
- <b>Note:</b> You can use your own environment variable or load it from the env file.

```bash
goose postgres postgres://aggregate:password@localhost/aggregate  up
```

5. **Build the project:** You can build the project using the makefile's command:

    ```bash
    make build/api
    ```
    This will create an executable file in the current directory.
    <b>Note: The generated executable is for the windows environment</b>
      <b>- However, You can find the linux build command within the makefile!</b>

6. **Run the project:** You can run the project using the `go run` or use <b>`MakeFile`</b> and do:

    ```bash
    make run/api
    ```

7. **MakeFile Help:** For additional supported commands run `make help`:

  ```makefile
  make help
  ```

  **Output:**
  ```
  make help
  Usage: 
  run/api            -  run the api application
  build/api          -  build the cmd/api application
  audit              -  tidy dependencies and format, vet and test all code
  db/migrations/up   -  run the up migrations using confirm as prerequisite
  vendor             -  tidy and vendor dependencies
  ```

### Description

The application accepts command-line flags for configuration, establishes a connection pool to a database, and publishes variables for monitoring the application. The published variables include the application version, the number of active goroutines and the current Unix timestamp.
  - This will start the application. You should be able to access it at `http://localhost:4000`.

<hr />

## Optional Parameters <a name = "optpars"></a>

You can view the **parameters** by utilizing the `-help` command. Here is a rundown of 
the available commands for a quick lookup.
- **smtp-sender:** Sets the sender for SMTP (email) communications. Default: "Groovy <no-reply@groovy.com>".
- **cors-trusted-origins [value]:** Trusted CORS origins (space separated)
- **db-dsn [string]:** PostgreSQL DSN (default "{Path to your .env holding your DSN}")
- **db-max-idle-conns [int]:** PostgreSQL max idle connections (default 25)
- **db-max-idle-time [string]:** PostgreSQL max connection idle time (default "15m")
- **db-max-open-conns [int]:** PostgreSQL max open connections (default 25)
- **env [string]:** Environment (development|staging|production) (default "development")
- **port [int]:** API server port (default 4000)
- **smtp-host [string]:** SMTP host (default "sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io"- I use mailtrap for tests)
- **smtp-password [string]:** SMTP password (default "xxxxx")
- **smtp-port [int]:** SMTP port (default 25)
- **smtp-sender [string]:** SMTP sender (default "Groovy <no-reply@groovy.com>")

- **notifier-delete-interval [int64]:** Interval in minutes for the notifier to delete old notifications (default 100)

Using `make run`, will run the API with a default connection string located 
in `cmd\api\.env`. If you're using `powershell`, you need to load the values otherwise you will get
a `cannot load env file` error. Use the PS code below to load it or change the env variable:
```powershell
$env:GROOVY_DB_DSN=(Get-Content -Path .\cmd\api\.env | Where-Object { $_ -match "GROOVY_DB_DSN" } | ForEach-Object { $($_.Split("=", 2)[1]) })
```

Alternatively, in unix systems you can make a .envrc file and load it directly in the makefile by importing like so:
```makefile
include .envrc
```

A succesful run will output:
```bash
make run/api
'Running cmd/api...'
go run ./cmd/api
{"level":"INFO","time":"2024-07-04T15:56:16Z","message":"Loading Environment Variables","properties":{"DSN":"cmd\\api\\.env"}}
{"level":"INFO","time":"2024-07-04T15:56:16Z","message":"database connection pool established"}
{"level":"INFO","time":"2024-07-04T15:56:16Z","message":"Starting RSS Feed Scraper","properties":{"Client Timeout":"15","Interval":"40s","No of Go Routines":"5","No of Retries":"3"}}
{"level":"INFO","time":"2024-07-04T15:56:16Z","message":"starting server","properties":{"addr":":4000","env":"development"}}
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

The project has existing tests represented by files ending with the word `"_test"` e.g `rssdata_test.go`

### Break down into end to end tests

Each test file contains a myriad of tests to run on various entities mainly functions.
The test files are organized into `structs of tests` and their corresponding test logic.

You can run them directly from the vscode test UI. Below represents test results for the scraper:

```bash
=== RUN   Test_application_rssFeedScraper
=== RUN   Test_application_rssFeedScraper/Test1
Fetching:  bbc
--- PASS: Test_application_rssFeedScraper/Test1 (0.00s)

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
As earlier mentioned, the api uses a myriad of flags which you can use to launch the application.
An example of launching the application with your `smtp server's setting` includes:
```bash
make build/api ## build api using the makefile
./bin/api.exe -smtp-username=pigbearman -smtp-password=algor ## run the built api with your own values

Direct Run: 
go run main.go
```

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

This application can be deployed using Docker and Docker Compose. Here are the steps to do so:
1. **Build the Docker image:** by navigating to the root directory.
```bash
cd aggregate
```
2. **Verify Configs:** Check and verify the following file incase you want to change any configs:
```bash
- docker-compose.yml
- Dockerfile
```
3. **Build The Container:** Run the following command to build the docker image based on the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```
docker compose up --build
```


Please remember you can use flags, mentioned [here](#optpars) while running the api by setting them in
the `Dockerfile` like so:

```bash
CMD ["./bin/api.exe", "-smtp-username", "smtp username", "-port", "your_port", "-smtp-password", "your_smtp_pass"]
```

<b>Note:</b> <strong>There is a pre-built</strong> package for anyone who may feel <i>less enthusiastic</i> about building
it themselves. You can get it going by doing:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/blue-davinci/aggregate:latest
```

## üéâ Acknowledgements <a name = "acknowledgement"></a>

- Hat tip to anyone whose code was used

## üì∞ Inspiration:
Aggregate was born from the necessity to streamline how we consume and manage the vast ocean of information available online. As avid tech enthusiasts and news followers, we often found ourselves juggling between multiple sources to stay updated. 

This sparked the idea to create a unified platform where all our favorite feeds could be aggregated into one seamless experience. Thus, Aggregate was conceived with a mission to simplify and enhance the way we access information.
