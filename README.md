## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Aggregate is a content aggregation platform designed to streamline information consumption. Its purpose is to centralize feeds from various sources‚Äîsuch as RSS and Atom‚Äîinto a unified stream. Users can effortlessly follow their favorite content, whether it‚Äôs news, blogs, or other updates. The project emphasizes efficiency, security, and a user-friendly experience, making it a valuable tool for staying informed in today‚Äôs fast-paced digital landscape. üöÄüåê

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run or contribute to this project, you'll need to have the following software installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/): The project is written in Go, so you'll need to have Go installed to run or modify the code.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/): The project uses a PostgreSQL database, so you'll need to have PostgreSQL installed and know how to create a database.
- A Go IDE or text editor: While not strictly necessary, a Go IDE or a text editor with Go support can make it easier to work with the code. I use vscode.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): You'll need Git to clone the repo.

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository:** Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/blue-davinci/aggregate.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd aggregate
    ```

3. **Install the Go dependencies:** The Go tools will automatically download and install the dependencies listed in the `go.mod` file when you build or run the project. To download the dependencies without building or running the project, you can use the `go mod download` command:

    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```
4. **Set up the database:** The project uses a PostgreSQL database. You'll need to create a new database and update the connection string in your configuration file or environment variables.
We use `GOOSE` for all the data migrations and `SQLC` as the abstraction layer for the DB. To proceed
with the migration, navigate to the `Schema` director:

```bash
cd internal\sql\schema
```
- Then proceed by using the `goose {connection string} up` to execute an <b>Up migration</b> as shown:
- <b>Note:</b> You can use your own environment variable or load it from the env file.

```bash
goose postgres postgres://aggregate:password@localhost/aggregate  up
```

5. **Build the project:** You can build the project using the makefile's command:

    ```bash
    make build/api
    ```
    This will create an executable file in the current directory.
    <b>Note: The generated executable is for the windows environment</b>

6. **Run the project:** You can run the project using the `go run` or use MakeFile and do:

    ```bash
    make run/api
    ```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
