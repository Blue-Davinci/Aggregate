## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Aggregate is a content aggregation platform designed to streamline information consumption. Its purpose is to centralize feeds from various sources‚Äîsuch as RSS and Atom‚Äîinto a unified stream. Users can effortlessly follow their favorite content, whether it‚Äôs news, blogs, or other updates. The project emphasizes efficiency, security, and a user-friendly experience, making it a valuable tool for staying informed in today‚Äôs fast-paced digital landscape. üöÄüåê

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run or contribute to this project, you'll need to have the following software installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/): The project is written in Go, so you'll need to have Go installed to run or modify the code.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/): The project uses a PostgreSQL database, so you'll need to have PostgreSQL installed and know how to create a database.
- A Go IDE or text editor: While not strictly necessary, a Go IDE or a text editor with Go support can make it easier to work with the code. I use vscode.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): You'll need Git to clone the repo.

<hr />
### Installing

1. **Clone the repository:** Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/blue-davinci/aggregate.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd aggregate
    ```

3. **Install the Go dependencies:** The Go tools will automatically download and install the dependencies listed in the `go.mod` file when you build or run the project. To download the dependencies without building or running the project, you can use the `go mod download` command:

    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```
4. **Set up the database:** The project uses a PostgreSQL database. You'll need to create a new database and update the connection string in your configuration file or environment variables.
We use `GOOSE` for all the data migrations and `SQLC` as the abstraction layer for the DB. To proceed
with the migration, navigate to the `Schema` director:

```bash
cd internal\sql\schema
```
- Then proceed by using the `goose {connection string} up` to execute an <b>Up migration</b> as shown:
- <b>Note:</b> You can use your own environment variable or load it from the env file.

```bash
goose postgres postgres://aggregate:password@localhost/aggregate  up
```

5. **Build the project:** You can build the project using the makefile's command:

    ```bash
    make build/api
    ```
    This will create an executable file in the current directory.
    <b>Note: The generated executable is for the windows environment</b>
      <b>- However, You can find the linux build command within the makefile!</b>

6. **Run the project:** You can run the project using the `go run` or use <b>`MakeFile`</b> and do:

    ```bash
    make run/api
    ```

7. **MakeFile Help:** For additional supported commands run `make help`:

  ```bash
  make help
  ```
  - **Output:**
  ```
  make help
  Usage: 
  run/api            -  run the api application
  build/api          -  build the cmd/api application
  audit              -  tidy dependencies and format, vet and test all code
  db/migrations/up   -  run the up migrations using confirm as prerequisite
  vendor             -  tidy and vendor dependencies
  ```

### Description

The application accepts command-line flags for configuration, establishes a connection pool to a database, and publishes variables for monitoring the application. The published variables include the application version, the number of active goroutines and the current Unix timestamp.
  - This will start the application. You should be able to access it at `http://localhost:4000`.

<hr />
## Optional Parameters <a name = "optpars"></a>

You can view the **parameters** by utilizing the `-help` command. Here is a rundown of 
the available commands for a quick lookup.
- **smtp-sender:** Sets the sender for SMTP (email) communications. Default: "Groovy <no-reply@groovy.com>".
- **cors-trusted-origins [value]:** Trusted CORS origins (space separated)
- **db-dsn [string]:** PostgreSQL DSN (default "{Path to your .env holding your DSN}")
- **db-max-idle-conns [int]:** PostgreSQL max idle connections (default 25)
- **db-max-idle-time [string]:** PostgreSQL max connection idle time (default "15m")
- **db-max-open-conns [int]:** PostgreSQL max open connections (default 25)
- **env [string]:** Environment (development|staging|production) (default "development")
- **port [int]:** API server port (default 4000)
- **smtp-host [string]:** SMTP host (default "sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io"- I use mailtrap for tests)
- **smtp-password [string]:** SMTP password (default "xxxxx")
- **smtp-port [int]:** SMTP port (default 25)
- **smtp-sender [string]:** SMTP sender (default "Groovy <no-reply@groovy.com>")
- **smtp-username [string]:** SMTP username (default "skunkhunt42")
- **baseurl [string]:** frontend url (default "http://localhost:5173")
- **activationurl [string]:** frontend activation url (default "http://localhost:5173/verify?token=")
- **passwordreseturl:** frontend password reset url (default "http://localhost:5173/reset?token=")

Using `make run`, will run the API with a default connection string located 
in `cmd\api\.env`. If you're using `powershell`, you need to load the values otherwise you will get
a `cannot load env file` error. Use the PS code below to load it or change the env variable:
```powershell
$env:GROOVY_DB_DSN=(Get-Content -Path .\cmd\api\.env | Where-Object { $_ -match "GROOVY_DB_DSN" } | ForEach-Object { $($_.Split("=", 2)[1]) })
```

Alternatively, in unix systems you can make a .envrc file and load it directly in the makefile by importing like so:
```makefile
include .envrc
```

A succesful run will output:
```bash
make run/api
'Running cmd/api...'
go run ./cmd/api
{"level":"INFO","time":"2024-07-04T15:56:16Z","message":"Loading Environment Variables","properties":{"DSN":"cmd\\api\\.env"}}
{"level":"INFO","time":"2024-07-04T15:56:16Z","message":"database connection pool established"}
{"level":"INFO","time":"2024-07-04T15:56:16Z","message":"Starting RSS Feed Scraper","properties":{"Client Timeout":"15","Interval":"40s","No of Go Routines":"5","No of Retries":"3"}}
{"level":"INFO","time":"2024-07-04T15:56:16Z","message":"starting server","properties":{"addr":":4000","env":"development"}}
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

The project has existing tests represented by files ending with the word `"_test"` e.g `rssdata_test.go`

### Break down into end to end tests

Each test file contains a myriad of tests to run on various entities mainly functions.
The test files are organized into `structs of tests` and their corresponding test logic.

You can run them directly from the vscode test UI. Below represents test results for the scraper:
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
As earlier mentioned, the api uses a myriad of flags which you can use to launch the application.
An example of launching the application with your `smtp server's setting` includes:
```bash
make build/api ## build api using the makefile
./bin/api.exe -smtp-username=pigbearman -smtp-password=algor ## run the built api with your own values

Direct Run: 
go run main.go
```
